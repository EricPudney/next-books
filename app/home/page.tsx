              This project - which is still under development - began as a way for me to practice using Next.js and has turned into a portfolio site as I am starting to look for jobs. It presents most of my collection of rare, antique and collectable books. You can look at the books using the booklist link, although you will need to create an account to look at individual books. I have recently added a chatbot which you can talk to via the Ask AI link, although it has an (intentionally) one-track mind.

              The Collection
            </h3>
            <p className="text-blue-800">
            The carousel above automatically updates whenever new books are added to the database. The data is fetched using SQL queries executed by a server action against a PostgreSQL database. <a className="text-blue-600 underline" href="https://zod.dev/">Zod</a> is used for schema validation to ensure data integrity. The carousel itself is built with <a className="text-blue-600 underline" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-multi-carousel">react-multi-carousel</a>, which I have found to be an excellent, easy-to-use library. Images for the books are mostly linked from a dropbox account, but I have started to migrate them to <a className="text-blue-600 underline" href="https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-blob">Vercel Blob</a> for more efficient storage, faster retrieval, and better integration with the rest of the app.

              Security
            </h3>
            <p className="text-emerald-800">
              I have implemented authentication and authorisation using <a className="text-blue-600 underline" href="https://jose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">JOSE</a>, with passwords hashed and salted using bcrypt before being stored in the database. Creating an account only requires an email and password — the email must be in a valid format but will not be used for any purpose, so it does not need to be your real address. Sessions are not currently renewed and expire after 7 days; tokens are signed but not encrypted since they contain no sensitive information. I am looking into adding oauth login via GitHub and Google as well. All code is automatically scanned using CodeQL Advanced via a GitHub action to detect security issues.

              Layout & Design
            </h3>
            <p className="text-purple-800">
            I am comfortable implementing designs, but I do not consider myself to be a designer. The overall look of this site was AI-assisted, with most of the visual design generated by Claude.AI — although I have drawn inspiration from other sources as well. I am in the process of refactoring some of the AI-generated HTML and CSS into more readable and reusable React components.
